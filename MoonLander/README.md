# MoonLander

MoonLander is a classic video game where a user drops a space lander onto the rough lunar surface without crashing. The ship cannot tough the uneven ground surface or the edge of the screen. It must also slow down before landing. Landing too hard will count as a crash. Boosters using the arrow keys will lift the ship up, left, and right. But beware! You only have a limited supply of fuel!

This student project was built to focus on C++ object-oriented programming. Most of the OpenGL code was provided by the instructor, as well as the game code and the code to draw the ground, platform, lander, and booster flames on screen. The student contributed the LANDER class and its implementation code. Student also contributed the POINT and VELOCITY classes to deal with physics and flight.
