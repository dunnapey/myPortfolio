PHOCUS ANDROID APP

PHOCUS is a concept student project Android Mobile App focused on increasing accountability and motivation. Users can use the app to create tasks or goals and then track their progress/consistency of each task. Users can set a timer for how much time they want to devote to a task, then set the number of times to repeat that task. Users can also set an alarm to receive a reminder to do a task at a certain time of day. Once a user has stayed consistently on task with completing their goals a funny meme image will be displayed to declare congratulations!

This student project was meant to enforce team-oriented mobile app development principles and best programming practices. Although the option to publish it to the Google Play Store was left to our team's discretion post-semester end, it was not published and there is no copyrights or legally binding agreements concerning this project or its materials.
