# Game Of Life

Game of Life is a simulation where sheep eat plants, wolves eat sheep, and hunters kill wolves. Sheep that eat enough multiply, wolves that eat enough multiply, and those that die disappear from the simulation. Wolves will chase sheep that are in range. Sheep will eat plants that are in range. And hunters will chase wolves that are in range. Thus goes the circle of life.

This student project was done in Java to enforce Java skills and app development principles.
